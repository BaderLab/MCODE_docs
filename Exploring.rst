Exploring Results Interactively
===============================

In addition to fine-tuning a multitude of parameters to enhance the analysis process, MCODE provides a real-time cluster exploration feature.
This can be divided into two components: exploring cluster boundaries and exploring cluster content.

The first exploration allows you to expand or reduce the cluster based on the node score using the Size Threshold Slider.
The second is the Node Attribute Enumerator which provides a summary of the cluster's node attributes and their frequency in the cluster.
Together they can inform the user about the cluster's "natural" boundaries in the context of the network and ensure functional consistency.

These are both explained in greater detail below.
